Integers are for representing whole numbers:
    rank - 10
    eggs = 12
    people - 3

Floats represents continues values:
    temperature = 10.2
    rainfall = 5.96
    elevation = 1031.88

Strings represent text:
    message = "Welcome to our online shop"
    name = "Carl"
    serial = "R001991981SW"

Lists represent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:
    members = ["Sandra Biskup", "Roger Matson"]
    pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 240]

Dictionaries represent pairs of keys and values:
    phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+3765435666"}
    volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9. "Rainer": 4392.1}

        Keys of Dictionaries can be extracted with:
            phone_numbers.keys()

        Values of Dictionaries can be extracted with:
            phone_numbers.values()

Tuples represent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:
    vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
    one_digits = (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

To find out what attributes a type has:
    dir(str)
    dir(list)
    dir(dict)

Documentation for a Python command can be found with:
    help(str)
    help(str.replace)
    help(dict.values)
