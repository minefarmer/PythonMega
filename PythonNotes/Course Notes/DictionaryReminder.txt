Dictionary Reminder
In the next lecture, you will learn more about dictionaries, so here's an example of a dictionary in case you forgot about them:

search_engines_users = {"google": 1000000000, "bing": 127000000, "duck duck go":12000000}

A dictionary is made of pairs of keys and values. For example, the first pair is "google": 1000000000 where "google" is the key and 1000000000 is the value of that key.
