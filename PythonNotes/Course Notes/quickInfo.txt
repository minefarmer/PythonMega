Quick Info
Here is a small secret about this course that will enhance your learning. Unlike most other courses where errors that occur in the code are cut out from the video, in this course, the coding experience is more natural. Instead of removing that section of the video where the code error showed up, I look at the error and explain what the error means, and then we fix the error together. That way you don't only learn how to code, you also learn how to fix your code when it does not work. Every programmer runs into tons of errors all the time. Knowing how to fix errors is as important as knowing how to program.
