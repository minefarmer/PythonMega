Note
In the next lecture, I use this in the code:

tiles = "Mapbox Bright"

Please use this instead:

tiles = "Stamen Terrain"

Mapbox Bright and Stamen Terrain are both types of base maps, but Mapbox Bright doesn't work anymore. Stamen Terrain works great, and you will see it creates a beautiful terrain map.
