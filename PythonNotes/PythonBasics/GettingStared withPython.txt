Cheatsheet (Getting Started with Python)
Congratulations! You have completed this section!

Here is a summary of what you learned in this section:

A Python program in Visual Studio Code can be executed using either (1) by pressing the run button or (2) by executing the commands below in the terminal:

py -3.9 file_name.py (Windows)

python3.9 file_name.py (Mac and Linux)

Note: You may need to replace 3.9 with the Python version you are using.

A Python shell can be started by executing the command below in the terminal:

py -3.9 (Windows)

python3.9 (Mac and Linux)

Note: You may need to replace 3.9 with the Python version you are using.

You can use the Python print() function to print out output in the terminal.

Variables are names that reference objects. They make the code more readable and allow the objects they refer to be easily reused inside a program.
